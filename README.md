# tute_dude_assignmentRepo
 This repository is created to submit assignments that are given by tutedude online course.

 Assignment_1: In the Task 1 of this assignment I have used variables and input function with the int data type to take ibnput from the user and used print function with +-/* arithmatic operators to do the operations and print the output as instructed in the assignment. 
 In Task 2 I have used input function and took string input as with default input python takes string as input and then I used the f string which allows you to format selected parts of a string, and then I brought out the desired output.

 Assignment_2: In the Task 1 of this assignment I have used the % operator to check if the number gives remainder as 0 , and with the use of conditonal if else statement I have driven out the desired output.
 In Task 2 I have used a for loop to find out the sum of 1 to 50 numbers.

 Assignent_3: In the Task 1 of this assignment I have defined a function factorial and in the parameters I have given n, I used a basic logical or operator for 0 and 1 condition and for the other part I used n*factorial(n-1), it calls the factorial function until it becomes 0. Then I printed it and found out the results.
In Task 2 I used math library which has these three function that are math.sqrt, math.sin, math.log , with the help of this predefined functions I generated the desired output.

Assignmnet_4: In the Task of this assignment I have used try and except block for exception handling and inside the try block I have used with open function to open a file and write the content in it. I gave the file name as sample.txt and mode as r which means read mode, then I used a for loop to iterate through the file and print the content. In the except block I gave the exception as FileNotFoundError and printed the error message.
In Task 2 I firstly took user input as a string in a variable and then I used with open function to open a file output.txt in write mode and then I used write function to write the content in it. I then used file.write and in parameter I gave the variable which I used to take user input. In the second part also I did the same but the change was in the mode I gave append mode and finally I oppend the file in read mde and used a for loop and print function with a strip to print the content of the file and eliminate white spaces.
